In all honestly, "Never Gonna Give You Up" is actually a good song.
Congrats to the internet for selecting such a masterpiece as a meme!

## Things To Implement

- video to ascii parser
  - python: opencv (cv2), pandas, numpy!
  - rust? all the packages look kinda painful to use...
- have a website with fun versions of it
  - counter every time a new ip visits the website -> mongo?
  - cool alternate album art/portraits of rick
